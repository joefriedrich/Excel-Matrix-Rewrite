# Excel-Matrix-Rewrite (aka pySAP-Security)
Code written to replace VBA code.  Looks up items in CSVs based on user input.
# Requirements
Requires Python 3.7.  Other versions may work, but this was our development environment.
It is not Python 2 compatable.
# Instructions
Move the sample data folders where you want, but you must document the location in the main code.
There is a data structure called a 'Company', and this structure must contain this information.
If you want to work with your own data, you must maintain this.
# Future Plans
0. Make code PEP-8 compliant.
1. Combine SAP production and SAP single approvers into one menu. 
2. Make a .ini file to house company specific information (moving data out of code).

(Program is expected to be depricated by the end of 2019.  Replaced by internal SAP (GRC) automation.)
